                Building and Installing HGSC_WGS_CNV
                ====================================

Requirements
============
Building HGSC_WGS_CNV requires a few programs and libraries to be present.

Check to ensure the system provides the followings

    GNU make
    Both C and C++ compiler (e.g. gcc/g++ or related modules)

The build requires autotools scripts like,

    autoheader
    autoconf
    autoreconf

The following external libraries are needed for the HGSC_WGS_CNV installation
    libbz2
    libcrypto
    libcurl
    libdl
    liblzma
    libm
    libpthread
    librt
    libssl
    libz

Building Configure
==================
Before the installation of HGSC_WGS_CNV, users need to first install htslib package.
https://github.com/samtools/htslib

HGSC_WGS_CNV has been tested against htslib from version 1.10 to 1.17.

Important Note:
htslib must be installed inside wgs_cnv directory. Please create a 'htslib' 
sub-directory like wgs_cnv/htslib if the 'htslib' sub-directory doesn't exist.
The 'htslib' sub-directory name should NOT include any version numbers.

Please follow the htslib 'INSTALL' instructions all the way to the final 
step 'make install' such as
    make prefix=<path to wgs_cnv/htslib directory> install

Once htslib is successfully installed, users can proceeds to build HGSC_WGS_CNV.
Please download any release package you prefer and decompress the package
    tar zxvf CNVScanner-release-version.tar.gz
    cd CNVScanner-release-version

Run the following to create a brand new configure for your system
    autoreconf -i

Once users have generated the configure file, then do the following
    ./configure
    make
    make install

The './configure' generates Makefiles for the compilation.

The 'make' compiles source code in both src/ and lib/
and generates executables.

The 'make install' command installs the compiled executables into the /usr/local
directory. Users can change the installation location by adding --prefix=DIR
option to the ./configure run or via 'make prefix=DIR install'.
